The file names are a bit confusing. 

## g_all until g4 are for reproducing the predator and grasshopper allocations.
the output is a csv file with all cages' predator allocations and 

## g5-g6.3 are for the litterbag allocation and data analysis/visualization.

g5 was for deciding which order to sample the litterbags
g6 sources the next three files (g6.1-g6.3)

**Check github for whether litterbag 6.1 or 6.1 v2 is more recently updated (this needs to be checked for import and viz files)
Plant richness and plant npp also had v2 files. 

==> from the looks of it, the v2 files were the ones i used for the talk (they have the updated themes)
